# bulk-rename
Bulk renaming program that I wrote in Python.
Basically takes a directory from a user and renames every file with a unique name, comprised of a user defined prefix and a program defined suffix.

Has the option to rename all files inside of directories for easier copying.

This is the v1.0 version, and there is more to come in order to make this a fully fledged program, with features such as outputting all the files into one folder, or renaming the folders as well.
