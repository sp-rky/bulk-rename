**v1.0**:
  
  Hello world!

  This is the v1.0 version, and there is more to come in order to make this a fully fledged program, with features such as outputting all the files into one folder, or renaming the folders as well.

**v1.1**:
  - Added the ability to rename folders as well as files.
  - Made the output text a bit easier to read.
  
  *Future goals for this project*:
  - Add a configuration file for certain settings eg silent mode (no output)
  - Make it able to be run from the command line with arguments (if that's possible lol)
  - Outputting files all into one folder
  - As much as I hate GUI's, I'm going to have to bite the bullet and make this a GUI application at some point.
